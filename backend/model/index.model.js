/**
 * The biggest poison is regret. Life is short and we only get one chance to live it. It's easy to make excuses and put off our dreams, but in the end, it's what we *don't* do that we regret most. Don't wait for the perfect time or the perfect experience â€“ there is no such thing. Live your life to the fullest and don't settle for the 80% version.
